# Ash igniter failure test fixture project

Minimal Mix project used as a fixture for `Ash.Igniter` failure-reporting tests.

- **Purpose:** Provides a real project directory for tests that verify un-run tasks and failures are properly logged when igniter runs fail.
- **Layout:** Standard Mix app with `ash` as a path dependency (points at the parent Ash repo).
